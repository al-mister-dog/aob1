    0: `Inflation is the decrease in purchasing power of a currency over time. A measure of this decline in purchasing power is the change in the average price level of a basket of goods and services over a certain period (e.g. the Consumer Price Index or CPI).`,
    1: `The CPI is a statistic that tracks changes in the cost of living by measuring the weighted average of prices of a selection of consumer goods and services, such as transportation, food, and medical care. It is calculated by taking the price changes of each item in the predetermined basket and averaging them together. Changes in the CPI are used to indicate periods of inflation or deflation in the economy. It is one of the most common measurements for assessing changes in the cost of living.`,
    2: `Prices can go up for a variety of reasons, typically divided into two categories: cost-push and demand-pull. Demand-pull inflation occurs when there is too much demand for certain goods, leading to an increase in prices. Cost-push inflation, on the other hand, is when expenses related to creating goods, like labor, raw materials, and capital goods, rise or become unavailable, resulting in increased prices even when there is no increase in demand.`,
    3: `The weights assigned to goods and services in households' spending are based on estimates of the relative importance of each product. For example, if a household spends 8% of their income on chocolate and 25% on transport, the weights for each would be 8 and 25 respectively. However, during times of structural change, the weighting schemes used to calculate price indices come under pressure. Price indices assume that the proportion of spending on items like food, clothing, housing, and travel will stay relatively constant over time. Statisticians must decide whether to hold the share of these goods in the consumption basket constant, or to adjust to new circumstances. Currently, transport spending is down, while other goods and services are up, meaning prices for transport services are rising at a slower rate than other items. Adjusting the weights to reflect the lower level of spending on travel will lead to a higher inflation number.`,
    4: `At the beginning of 2021, a global surge in inflation emerged. This has been attributed to several different causes, such as fiscal and monetary stimulus due to the pandemic, product shortages (including computer chips and energy), price gouging, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The following chart displays the changes in inflation rate from 2000 to 2020.`,
    5: `What would be the peak rate of inflation, as estimated by the Bank of England, if the majority of inflation was caused by price increases (and their weighting in economic models)? Does this reflect the prices we experience as consumers? Use the CPI calculator to find out.`
